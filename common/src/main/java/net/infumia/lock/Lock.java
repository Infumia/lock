/**
 * Represents a distributed lock that provides mutual exclusion across processes and threads.
 * <p>
 * This interface defines the contract for distributed locking operations, supporting both
 * synchronous and asynchronous execution patterns. Implementations are expected to be
 * <strong>non-reentrant</strong>, meaning the same thread cannot acquire the same lock
 * multiple times without first releasing it.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Thread Safety:</strong> All implementations must be thread-safe and support
 * concurrent access from multiple threads. However, lock acquisition state is maintained
 * per instance, not per thread.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Usage Pattern:</strong></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * Lock lock = lockProvider.create("my-resource", executor);
 *
 * // Basic usage
 * if (lock.acquire(Duration.ofSeconds(30))) {
 *     try {
 *         // Critical section - access shared resource
 *         performCriticalOperation();
 *     } finally {
 *         lock.release();
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * // Convenience usage
 * lock.withLock(() -> {
 *     performCriticalOperation();
 * });
 *
 * // Asynchronous usage
 * lock.acquireAsync(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
 *     .thenCompose(acquired -> {
 *         if (acquired) {
 *             return performAsyncOperation()
 *                 .whenComplete((result, throwable) -> lock.release());
 *         }
 *         return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(null);
 *     });
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p><strong>Lock Semantics:</strong></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Non-reentrant:</strong> Same instance cannot acquire lock multiple times</li>
 *   <li><strong>Timeout-based:</strong> Acquisition attempts can timeout</li>
 *   <li><strong>Manual renewal:</strong> Locks can be explicitly renewed to extend expiry</li>
 *   <li><strong>Automatic expiry:</strong> Locks expire after a configurable duration</li>
 * </ul>
